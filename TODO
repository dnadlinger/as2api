 - Proper command-line options

 - Have some way of pre-populating namespace with standard types (String,
   Object) so that type resolution doesn't complain when they're not
   found

 - Hide private class members

 - Automatically pull any package.html contents into package-summary page.

 - Be package/class centric, rather than sourcepath centric (i.e. we should
   be given a list of packages to document, and just load what's required to
   document the API of those types)
 
 - Automatically include the default CSS with the generated files (if there's
   no file there already)
