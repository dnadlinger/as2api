 - Proper command-line options

 - Have some way of pre-populating namespace with standard types (String,
   Object) so that type resolution doesn't complain when they're not
   found

 - Hide private class members

 - Automatically pull any package.html contents into package-summary page.

 - Be package/class centric, rather than sourcepath centric (i.e. we should
   be given a list of packages to document, and just load what's required to
   document the API of those types)
 
 - Automatically include the default CSS with the generated files (if there's
   no file there already)

 - add --lang attribute so that generated HTML may include this metadata
   (maybe once there's some kind of gettext support for generated strings)

 - Maybe copy content of @author into HTML <meta name="Author" ...>
   On the other hand, the @author tag sucks

 - add parameter to specify a CSS to copy, rather than using the default

 - User comments?

 - Handling of hex integer constants appears to be broken -- '0xff' gets
   treated as IntegerToken<0>, IdentifierToken<xff> (I think).
